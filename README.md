# GroceryStoreAnalysis
Descriptive, RFM and price elasticity of demand analysis done on Ta Feng grocery store data.

The dataset contains four months of data between the years 2000 and 2001.

The RFM analysis was successful, but the elasticities were too high to be trustworthy as they got mostly positive values,
i.e. demand rose when prices also went up.
